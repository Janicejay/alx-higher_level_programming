# PYHON- DATA STRUCTURES: LISTS, TUPLES

## ABOUT

`DATA STRUCTURES IN PYTHON`
They are components for storing and organizing data. they are used for representing and handling data in various ways. Some of the common data structures in `python` are:

- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Strings
- Arrays
- Stacks and Queues
- Linked lists 
- Trees
- Graphs
- Deques <br>

***But here, our focus will be on lists and tuples.***

+ `LISTS`: List is a built-in data structure in python used to store and handle data or collection of items. Lists are defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of items within square brackets [ ]. An example is:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
subset = numbers[1:4]
print(subset)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]

+ `TUPLES`: This a built-in data structure similar to a list but the difference is that elements in a tuple cannot be changed. Tuples are defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of items within parentheses (). here's an example:

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits[0])  # Output: "apple"
print(fruits[1])  # Output: "banana"
