# PYTHON INHERITANCE

## ABOUT

`Python Inheritance` is a key feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (known as a "subclass" or "derived class") to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (known as a "superclass" or "base class").

	> "explicit is better than implicit"

*The quote above is by **Tim Peters** a Python developer. It simply means it's better to be explicit with whatever you are doing rather than being implicit*.

### IMPORTANT POINTS ON PYTHON INHERITANCE
- Superclass/Base Class/Parent Class
	This is the class whose attributes and methods are inherited by another class.

- Subclass/Derived Class/Child Class
	This is the class that inherits attributes and methods from another class.

- Inheriting Attributes and Method
	A subclass can access all the attributes and methods of its superclass.

- Syntax
	In Python, inheritance is achieved by including the superclass name in parentheses after the subclass name when defining the subclass.

- Extending Functionality
	Subclasses can always add new attributes and methods, as well as override existing methods from the superclass.
